# Hirasawa Project
The Hirasawa Project is an early WIP osu! server extendable by plugins

## Project ethos 
The ethos behind Hirasawa is to make a vanilla-like experience that can be easily expanded with plugins to tailor a specific experience, Bancho should identical to the end user as osu!Bancho while web is allowed to have it's own feel but contain an identical feature-set

## But wait I've got this good idea for a new feature
Brilliant, this is where we introduce you to our plugin store, you can create your plugin and upload it to our store (coming soon) where other users can install for this specific experience

## Repositories
